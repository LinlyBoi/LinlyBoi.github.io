	 			WHO IS LINLY?!


	Linly is one of many names I go by (See: Macks, Carlos, Aly etc.)  
	I am currently a CS student aspiring to be a cybersecurity specialist while also having other interests such as game development (modding) and  web development. 	<br>	Most of the projects I have worked on so far were rather small but include a GUI frontend for a twitter scraping tool in Python, an extremely basic art gallery website with mild CSS styling. 
	My non computer science interests include gaming (first person shooters and strategy games primarily) , casual group sports such as beach tennis/volleyball and finally listening to all sorts of music ranging from german rap to jazz. <br>

  I was born in Egypt, grew up in Alexandria spending most of my time by the beach. 
  I also have the russian nationality because my mother is russian and people often considered me superior or more intelligent due to that fact which didn't make sense to me back in the day.   I was sent to a private school where I wasn't exactly always top of my class but made quite the impression on all my teachers nonetheless I enjoyed being in a schoolwork environment and found studying alone at home to be rather boring which is why I always made sure to make the most out of my school time so I could have the chance to play at home without compromising my academic performance.
		 
  In middle school I started participating in all sorts of school activities such as broadcasts and acting in plays or events which is still something I am really thankful for to this day because it helped me overcome a lot of anxiety that revolved around being surrounded by a group of people even if I was only pretending to be confident then I still believe that no one is truly confident but rather remain self composed when it matters.<br>
		
  Highschool was an absolute mess for me because the entire educational sytem was getting changed even if it was for the better on paper, in practice it was a total disaster because I had no idea what was coming next but even then I just attempted to do my best and try to make the most out of it which did work out (barely) since I still got into the college I wanted studying what I love most!
